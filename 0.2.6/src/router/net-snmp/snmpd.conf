# EXAMPLE.conf:
#   An example configuration file for configuring the ucd-snmp snmpd agent.
#
###############################################################################
#
# This file is intended to only be an example.  If, however, you want
# to use it, it should be placed in /usr/local/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf.
# When the snmpd agent starts up, this is where it will look for it.
#
# You might be interested in generating your own snmpd.conf file using
# the "snmpconf" program (perl script) instead.  It's a nice menu
# based interface to writing well commented configuration files.  Try it!
#
# Note: This file is automatically generated from EXAMPLE.conf.def.
# Do NOT read the EXAMPLE.conf.def file! Instead, after you have run
# configure & make, and then make sure you read the EXAMPLE.conf file
# instead, as it will tailor itself to your configuration.

# All lines beginning with a '#' are comments and are intended for you
# to read.  All other lines are configuration commands for the agent.

#
# PLEASE: read the snmpd.conf(5) manual page as well!

# Access Control
###############################################################################

# YOU SHOULD CHANGE THE "COMMUNITY" TOKEN BELOW TO A NEW KEYWORD ONLY
# KNOWN AT YOUR SITE.  YOU *MUST* CHANGE THE NETWORK TOKEN BELOW TO
# SOMETHING REFLECTING YOUR LOCAL NETWORK ADDRESS SPACE.

# By far, the most common question I get about the agent is "why won't
# it work?", when really it should be "how do I configure the agent to
# allow me to access it?"
#
# By default, the agent responds to the "public" community for read
# only access, if run out of the box without any configuration file in
# place.  The following examples show you other ways of configuring
# the agent so that you can change the community names, and give
# yourself write access as well.
#
# The following lines change the access permissions of the agent so
# that the COMMUNITY string provides read-only access to your entire
# NETWORK (EG: 10.10.10.0/24), and read/write access to only the
# localhost (127.0.0.1, not its real ipaddress).
#
# For more information, read the FAQ as well as the snmpd.conf(5)
# manual page.

####
# First, map the community name (COMMUNITY) into a security name
# (local and mynetwork, depending on where the request is coming
# from):

#agentaddress udp:161,udp6:161

#           incl/excl subtree                          mask
view all    included  .1                               80
